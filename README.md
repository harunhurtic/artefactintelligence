📱 Welcome to the repository for Artefact Intelligence — a proof-of-concept web-application designed to enhance museum visitor engagement by adapting and delivering personalized artefact descriptions using AI, based on John H. Falk’s Museum Visitor Experience Model. This web-application uses a custom AI assistant powered by GPT-4o-mini using OpenAI's "Assistant's API" and "Audio API" to personalize and narrate museum artefact descriptions.

🎓 Academic Context:

This application was developed as part of a Master’s Thesis. Title: "Artefact Intelligence: Using AI to Enhance Museum Visitor Engagement Through Personalized Artefact Descriptions", Author: Harun Hurtic, Institution: NTNU – Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Year: 2025.

🧠 How It Works:

1. Visitors begin by answering a short profiling questionnaire. 
2. Based on their responses, they are categorized into one of five motivational visitor types from Falk’s Museum Visitor Experience Model.
3. Visitors can also choose language of adaptation and narrations, along with the narrator's voice.
4. Artefact descriptions are then adapted in real-time by the AI to match the visitor's profile.
5. Visitors can explore artefacts, read adapted descriptions, or optionally listen to AI-generated narrations.

🔍 Future Development:

The system is a proof-of-concept. Future improvements may include multilingual support, deeper voice personalization, and broader applicability across museums.
